Take it one layer, one breath, one hour at a time.
Cold days ask for softness, not speed.
This season moves slowly — you can too.
This too shall pass
Even in frozen ground, quiet things are preparing to grow.
Wrap up, slow down — you're still moving.
This isn't forever. Just for now.
This day counts, even if it’s quiet.
Even in the cold, you’re still here. That’s enough.
